					<p>Hello World! It is I, THE Taylor Clark. I was born and raised in the great state of Texas. I am one of the few blue dots drowning in this conservative state. When I graduated high school, I packed my bags and left my itty bitty hometown to go to The University of Texas at Austin! Hook 'Em Horns! I majored in Communication Sciences and Disorders and graduated in December 2014. I am currently a software tester at Samsung! I don't miss going to class everyday, but I'm excited to begin learning how to code! I live with my crazy hot fiance, David, and our extremely handsome dog, Ender! David and I got engaged two years ago and we have our wedding date set for October 14, 2017!</p>
